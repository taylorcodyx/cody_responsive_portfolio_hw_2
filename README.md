Responsive Portfolio for Taylor Cody made with Bootstrap. 



I drew inspiration from a few other developers portfolios that were created with Bootstrap. 

Using the Google Chrome dev tools, I played around with certain elements and designs and used the 'Toggle Device Toolbar' tool to play with the responsiveness of the design in real time. 

Frankly I wanted to keep the page simple and made sure that the nav links worked as they should and that the html was in correct syntax. 

Juniper Design is an inspiration I have for a potential "nickname" for some of my real work down the road. My cat's name is Juniper and I like the ring of it. 

I included a link at the end of the About Me section that redirects you to the contact page as well.
